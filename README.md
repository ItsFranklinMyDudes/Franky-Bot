hope you have an idea what the bot can do :P, enjoy

Step to get it working
-download as .zip, extract the files, in File Explorer go to the Path Bar and do 'cmd' to open the Command Prompt, in there do 'npm init --y' it will download the package.json file, then download the list here 'npm i discord.js colors express figlet got moment mongoose ms ms-prettify' and it should download all the packages needed, if not do them one by one
-get your bots token and put it in the config.json file, go to [Discord Deveolper Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to get the token and invite it to your server to test it
-once its in your server, right click on the bot to get the ID, if you cant see it go to, User Settings > Advance > Deveolper Mode, tuirn that on, same thing with the guild (server) but it wont get used but put it in anyways. to catch all the errors put in a bot log channel ID, last for the IDs put in yours to use all commands even the ones are blocked for everyone
-now for the DataBase, go to [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) and create an account (click try for free), you can either put in your details or sign up with google. once you have done that, you should be brought to the Atlas welcome screen, 1st question for the set up, Build a new application, 2nd question, other and put in Discord bot or whatever, 3rd question, JavaScript, that is what Franky is using if u want to use anything else go for it but JavaScript is perfered. Once that is done choose how much how much you want, but go for the free one since its pretty good, you can leave everything the way it is but choose a name for it, can always change it later. put in username and password to connect to the DB, put in your IP so nothing can do wrong. click on connect, and choose the second one (Connect Your Application the one with the cloud), copy the bit of code and paste it in the config.json mongodb make sure you put in the password it is right next to the username, remove the <> the paste in your password.

and your done enjoy the Bot, if you have any problems go to my server also if you want to get the lastest updates on Franky -> [Click Here](https://discord.gg/pZwV7YXztt)
